The numerus clausus PDF creator

## Sure?

Yes, Norton Commander is out of DOS business.
But the team around me was keen to rewrite 
[Midnight Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerus_clausus)
from scratch, say as good will thing.

But all went wrong. Confused by #NS labels in
#ObjectiveC codebase (private headers), we figured
the next best step would be to study electrical engineering.
To do so, we enrolled at [MIT](https://mit.edu) by hacking
the registration system. Once in, we printed the blueprint
of this application, on an 
[HP DeskJet 560C](http://hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=313)
to increase authenticity authentic authentication authorisation
authorized by the self-elected 
[NC committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerus_clausus).

## Abstract 

This application you can see here in action can be used to
produce mathematics quiz exam tests things. Locally, on your
Windows, Mac or Linux PC or machine. Be it ARM RISC, intel CISC
or [Cisco CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html),
no matter where, it will produce them. On your screen in a browser.
Or as PDF to print. Imagine the possibilities. All in native Go.
And no, use your own browser to enjoy the app. We do not bundle insecure rotten bullshit.
WE NOT!
